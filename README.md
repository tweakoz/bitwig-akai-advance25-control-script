# bitwig-akai-advance25-control-script
Basic transport controls for advance 25 (and probably other Akai Advance keyboards)

## What it has, what it doesn't
Right now this will send basic midi messages for the pads and keyboard.
It will send the transport controls for play, stop, record and loop.
The midi pots need some love.

#Installation
Place the Akai folder in your Controller Scripts folder.
